# Graph-Drawer
Graph drawing program which may become someday a graph drawing library for SFML

To run program you will need to put SFML dll's into program biuld destination.
There are included the onece I used for testing it (compiled for 32 Bit windows). 
You just need to unzip the "dll libraries.zip" file just where it is and how it is
(So use the "unzip here" option).
